In the past, all variables in JavaScript were declared using the keyword var.

These variables were function scoped, meaning their scope was within the function enclosing them, and this could sometimes be confusing to developers coming from other languages.

Quite simply, block scoping means that a new scope is created between a pair of { }.

The variables declared using the keywords let and const only exist within the innermost block that surrounds them.

{% highlight js %}
var name = 'shimdh';
console.log(name);
{% endhighlight %}
