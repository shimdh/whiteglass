### Variable Declarations: let, const, and Block Scoping

In the past, all variables in JavaScript were declared using the keyword var.

These variables were function scoped, meaning their scope was within the function enclosing them, and this could sometimes be confusing to developers coming from other languages.

{% highlight js %}
var price = 10; // Global Declaration

function showPrice() {
    var price = 12; // Local Declaration using var
    console.log(price); // 12
}
showPrice();
console.log(price); // 10
{% endhighlight %}

Following is an example of function level scopes with IIFE:
{% highlight js %}
var price = 10; // Global Declaration

(function () {
    var price = 12; // Local Declaration using var
    console.log(price); // 12
})();

console.log(price); // 10
{% endhighlight %}

### Block Scoping with let and const

Quite simply, block scoping means that a new scope is created between a pair of { }.

The variables declared using the keywords let and const only exist within the innermost block that surrounds them.

{% highlight js %}
let nbr = 42;
{
    let nbr = 1000;
}

console.log(nbr);
{% endhighlight %}

We now know that var is bound to function scope, whereas let and const are block scopes, which means if you've got a set of curly brackets (a block of code), you have a block scope.

The values of the variables created using const need to be assigned during declaration and cannot be changed later in the program.

{% highlight js %}
const value = 42;

console.log(value); // 42

value = 1000; // TypeError
{% endhighlight %}

On the other hand, unlike let, const creates immutable variables.

trying to change the value of a const variable will throw a typeerror.

Make sure that you always initialize the variable with a value declared using const; otherwise it will throw an error.

If you know that the value of your variables is not going to change throughout your code, you should be using const; otherwise use let to declare your variables.

We recommend moving away from the practice of using var to declare variables as it is cleaner, more efficient, and easy to debug if you use block scoping. let and const avoid the source of misunderstanding, especially for programmers with expectations set by languages with block scope.

let and const throw an exception if you try to access the variables declared by them outside the blocks they were declared and do away with hoisting, helping you localize the effects of your code fragments.

This Reference Error is technically called a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) error because you are accessing a variable that's been declared but not yet initialized.

Trying to get or set the variable at this point raises a Reference Error.

When the program flow reaches the declaration, the variable is then set to the value specified in the statement; otherwise it is set to undefined if there is no assignment in the statement.

typeof is a safe way to check if a variable exists or not.

const is used to declare an immutable variable but it does not make the value contained in the variable immutable.

It will only freeze the properties of the object passed to it.

Remember that Object.freeze() is shallow.
