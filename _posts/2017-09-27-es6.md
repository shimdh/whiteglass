In the past, all variables in JavaScript were declared using the keyword var.

These variables were function scoped, meaning their scope was within the function enclosing them, and this could sometimes be confusing to developers coming from other languages.

{% highlight js %}
var price = 10; // Global Declaration
function showPrice() {
    var price = 12; // Local Declaration using var
    console.log(price); // 12
}
showPrice();
console.log(price); // 10
{% endhighlight %}

Following is an example of function level scopes with IIFE:
{% highlight js %}
var price = 10; // Global Declaration
(function () {
    var price = 12; // Local Declaration using var
    console.log(price); // 12
})();
    console.log(price); // 10
{% endhighlight %}


Quite simply, block scoping means that a new scope is created between a pair of { }.

The variables declared using the keywords let and const only exist within the innermost block that surrounds them.
